# Contribution to this repository

I assume you are here because you have resources you want to share or you are the curious kind. Nevertheless, I'll try my best and make the contribution process as easy as possible:

* First, make sure you're not on the main branch, to do this create a branch.

* Finally and most importantly, before you add the resource(s), make sure you peruse them so that you know the heading to place them in. This is because we don't want beginners encountering intermediate or advanced Bash concepts and ditching the language because,"Bash is Hell".
Also, I'm very busy with school and other commitments so I can't assure that I'll go through every resource submitted and that's why I trust you with this, will you help me by doing the best job you can?
